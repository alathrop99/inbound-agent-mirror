We have dentrix and I got to be honest with you. I despise dentrix. It's like one of the most bugged down old softwares. They're just clunky and weird. So, yeah, the idea was basically to move to cloud because, you know, right now, like I have all these outside vendors. I have nexhealth. I have Pearl AI. I have all this kind of things tapping into my system and I know you guys are pretty comprehensive all in one kind of encompassing solution. So, I kind of wanted to really play with your software like in a sandbox and just kind of feel it out. I also wanted to ask what the… transition time frame is and data transfer, like how do you guys do that? And like what's involved and all that stuff?",

But for scenarios just like this where it's like we're on kind of a time crunch, I know we can expedite things. It's not going to be, you know, the typical kind of seamless transition that we always do. It's still going to be a pretty good transition but we'll just do a couple things to make sure you're up and running able to use the software. So it can look like a couple different things. But yeah, I know back when, you know, the California wildfire happened, you know, there was offices that were like we need this tomorrow and so it was like a Thursday and by Monday, we would have them at least able to use software and be able to see patients.

We'll make a copy of it because we don't mess with any of the data. Like we're not going to be manipulating or changing it. Really, we'll just make a copy of it, have that, and then that's where we'll clean up the data. So typically, what we'll do is start with that with the preliminary conversion. But depending on, you know, when you need everything done by that's what we'll kind of change the order of things just to make it go by a little bit quicker. And then usually what we'll do is make sure you just complete all the training before going live that way, you just make sure you're having everything set up, the right way. Usually I mean, it's most people pick up curve in about one to three days. I know there's eight sessions before you go live usually, but we can usually combine a couple or, you know, change some things around, see what makes the most sense for you guys.",

With the guided, we'll obviously sit down on the meeting. So depending on when we're able to do that just because we like to start with the initial demo.

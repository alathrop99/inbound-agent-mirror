      "text": "Sure. No. So, we\u2026 kind of like a smaller practice boutique practice, right? With fee for service, but I'm buying in the second location and I really want to move away from the server. We have dentrix and I got to be honest with you. I despise dentrix. It's like one of the most bugged down old softwares. They're just clunky and weird. So, yeah, the idea was basically to move to cloud because, you know, right now, like I have all these outside vendors. I have nexhealth. I have Pearl AI. I have all this kind of things tapping into my system and I know you guys are pretty comprehensive all in one kind of encompassing solution. So, I kind of wanted to really play with your software like in a sandbox and just kind of feel it out. I also wanted to ask what the\u2026 transition time frame is and data transfer, like how do you guys do that? And like what's involved and all that stuff?"

And that's why? Okay. Well, congratulations. Yeah, thank you. That's definitely very exciting. And I hate to hear that uh, you\u2019re not super happy with dentrix currently."

    {
      "timestamp": "1:52",

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2:00",
      "speaker": "Kevin",
      "text": "Oh, wow. Well, that is, I feel like you're not alone in that. Dentrix actually is our most common conversion that we see. So, I know for the transition, typically, it takes about 30 to 35 days, but are you on any kind of timeline? And when you were needing it done by?"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2:16",
      "speaker": "Lenard",
      "text": "So, I am right. So the, well, I'm not at my practice, but the other practice, we are closing\u2026 in about a month."

      "text": "And I will have to transfer a license. So I don't want to be paying for licenses if I'm going to be signing up with, you know, with curve dental. I also, they don't have, the server is about to die in that second location and I don't want to be paying for the server if I don't need it."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2:47",
      "speaker": "Kevin",
      "text": "Yeah, that makes sense. Well, I was going to say, I know, so I mentioned typically, it's about 30 to 35 days. But for scenarios just like this where it's like we're on kind of a time crunch, I know we can expedite things. It's not going to be, you know, the typical kind of seamless transition that we always do. It's still going to be a pretty good transition but we'll just do a couple things to make sure you're up and running able to use the software. So it can look like a couple different things. But yeah, I know back when, you know, the California wildfire happened, you know, there was offices that were like we need this tomorrow and so it was like a Thursday and by Monday, we would have them at least able to use software and be able to see patients. So I know we are able to expedite some things here and there for you."

    },
    {
      "timestamp": "3:33",
      "speaker": "Kevin",
      "text": "Not really a risk of patient data loss. It's just more of a we'll put the data in a little bit after. So you'll still have it. We'll make a copy of it because we don't mess with any of the data. Like we're not going to be manipulating or changing it. Really, we'll just make a copy of it, have that, and then that's where we'll clean up the data. So typically, what we'll do is start with that with the preliminary conversion. But depending on, you know, when you need everything done by that's what we'll kind of change the order of things just to make it go by a little bit quicker. And then usually what we'll do is make sure you just complete all the training before going live that way, you just make sure you're having everything set up, the right way. Usually I mean, it's most people pick up curve in about one to three days. I know there's eight sessions before you go live usually, but we can usually combine a couple or, you know, change some things around, see what makes the most sense for you guys."

    {
      "timestamp": "4:32",
      "speaker": "Kevin",
      "text": "I know. Yeah, I know what we definitely do have. I've seen that for some offices too is like maybe even come on site, do it for a day so it can look like a couple of different things. So when I, I'll connect you with one of our regional directors so they'll be able to discuss some of those exact timeframes with you and just figure out exactly what makes the most sense for you. And then."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "4:54",
      "speaker": "Lenard",
      "text": "Because I really like I said, I don't want to be paying for a license on eaglesoft if I don't have to, because it's you know, a lot of money actually, it's like four or five grand."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "5:01",
      "speaker": "Kevin",
      "text": "Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely. And then I know also, you mentioned you want to do a sandbox, so we should be able to do that for you as well. We'll just definitely want to do things sooner than later. Do you have any time maybe this week to walk through everything?"

      "timestamp": "5:39",
      "speaker": "Lenard",
      "text": "Let me ask this question, what are we talking timeframe as far as like how long, how much time will it take for me to get into the sandbox and play it out with it?"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "5:47",
      "speaker": "Kevin",
      "text": "Oh, I mean, we could potentially like if we did the demo tomorrow, we could even potentially have a sandbox same day. I think usually for that, do a couple things, we can do a guided or an unguided. With the unguided, we just usually send over an NDA beforehand. With the guided, we'll obviously sit down on the meeting. So depending on when we're able to do that just because we like to start with the initial demo. So you at least see it, make sure it's a potential good fit. And then from there, we'll do the sandbox."

One is that we want to make sure that your company, your software has a, very airtight cybersecurity like hipaa, and all that stuff especially with like against hacking and whatnot. So we want to make sure that one is airtight. And number two, we want to make sure that you guys provide just about everything. I know that you guys don't do the phones. And I know Arpan, he mentioned that he used mango for the phones along with Curve dental. But other than the phone, he told me like everything that we have with all these different companies, he said everything is with Curve. So I want to make sure that's the case. And then lastly also the pricing because the way he described to me, he was like just this one low fee which is like less than what I paid just to Weave. You get all of this. So I was like, wow, I have to take the call."

But yeah, typically, when I see people using, you know, dentrix, weave, Nexhealth, Vine, dexis, just all those, you know, different softwares. Usually they end up saving a fair amount just because, yeah, everything's going to be done inside of Curve for you and we'll walk through all those features for you on the demo as well. I guess, yeah, honestly, I appreciate you walking through all that for me. I don't have a ton of other questions. I know usually the demos take maybe about an hour. Is there a time maybe next week that would work well to walk through everything?"
